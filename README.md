🧠 AI Logic Explanation

The system uses rule-based analysis to simulate intelligent decision-making. Based on appliance type, usage duration, and energy patterns, it provides contextual insights similar to smart energy platforms.

📌 Assumptions & Limitations

AI insights are rule-based (not heavy ML models)

Usage data is user-input driven

Built for demonstration of system design and intelligent processing
